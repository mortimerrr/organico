# Organico

## We Got Coders Final Project 
We Got Coders is a consultancy that provides experts in agile web development, specialising in Ruby technology.

Organico is a single page app that helps people source organic produce in their area.
Users (shoppers or merchants) can register, they can see some shops and their tags, they can paginate 
between the results and they can also see corresponding markers on the provided map. 
Clicking on a marker will make the map zoom-in on that shop.
Users can also view the profile of a shop where the products of that shop will be listed (if that shop has uploaded any) 
This app was created as a final project at We Got Coders where I've attended a 3-month Full-Stack Web Development course.
